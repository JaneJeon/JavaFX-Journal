# Portable terminal scaffold

Just a prototype for another project I'm doing.

I thought I'd start with the GUI part, and I wanted to create a terminal-like desktop application, where everything is done by typing.

The reason I'm not just using the terminal and am actually making a portable terminal clone is that 1. I want to have *complete* control over what is displayed (e.g. background image) and 2. I want to make a simple application that people can just double click and run (low entry barrier).

My goal for this repo is to finish an implementation that can be used in other projects to just plug in and have a terminal UI ready.

Here's the 'terminal' in action:

Still a long ways to go!
