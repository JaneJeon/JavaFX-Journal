# A portable, declarative terminal written in JavaFX

This is a terminal-like desktop application front-end that takes users' input and passes it along to appropriate classes (this scaffold follows the MVC pattern).

In addition, there are a couple of key combination actions as well, such as taking screenshots, changing font, etc.

You can modify the Input class to make this a fully-fledged terminal application.

Also, I literally just started learning JavaFX a day ago. Please don't hurt me
